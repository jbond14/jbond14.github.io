Roger Blobaum has a cult following and is depicted in various ways in a number of movies. One such movie is Signs by M. Night Shyamalan. Dr. Blobaum has a cameo in Signs. In this movie Dr. Blobaum appears as Dr. Bimbu, the author of the book on the aliens in the tin foil hat scene. 

Dr. Bimbu predicts a grim future for the corn farming family with great accuracy, to the tin foil hat community. The aliens in Signs are Monsanto and Bayer intent on eradicating humanity from within the corn. 

The key to victory comes from the homeland of the director and the solution is to use water. The use of water to defeat the aliens is a clue to the viewer to use water to wash their GMO vegetables. There is a speech about beliefs and 14 lights. 

Signs was released on Roger's grandson's 16th birthday along with other movies including Resident Evil, Austin Powers Goldmember, and more.
