Roger Blobaum seems to have some kind of cult following in Hollywood. He is depicted in a number of movies. One such movie is Signs by M. Night Shyamalan. Dr. Blobaum has a cameo in this movie as Dr. Bimbu, the author of the book on the aliens in the tin foil hat scene shown in the image above. 

Roger is retired now, and 93 years old, in the past he was the world's greatest organic activist. There is a twist on the whole movie so you can see it as organic versus GMO along with the story of the family versus the aliens. 

Dr. Bimbu predicts a grim future for the corn farming family with great accuracy to the tin foil hat community. Dr. Blobaum has been predicting this same thing for decades. The aliens in Signs are Monsanto and Bayer intent on eradicating humanity from within the corn. The aliens come from the corn using a toxin. In real life this toxin is called glyphosate which is an herbicide that gets into the food supply in trace amounts. Glyphosate has been causing a lot of trouble.  

The key to victory comes from the homeland of the director and is to use water. The use of water to defeat the aliens is a queue to the viewer to use water to defeat monsanto and bayer. In other words, wash your vegetables, especially if they are GMO. 

There is a speech about beliefs and 14 lights. Do you believe in organic or GMO?
