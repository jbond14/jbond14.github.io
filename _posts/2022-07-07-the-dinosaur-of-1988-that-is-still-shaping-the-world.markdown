Roger Blobaum is the dinosaur of 1988. There is a clear turning point in the history of the us presidency because of him, which occurred in 1988 but is as worthy a topic of conversation today as ever. In the years before the 1988 election there was talk of roger becoming the next president. Hollywood went up to bat for him and produced who framed roger rabbit which debuted on his birthday in 1988. 

Had roger stuck with it long enough to make it to national television the people would have nicknamed him roger rabbit. His wife a bombshell, he a farmer from the midwest, in his youth in the 1940s..It is fun for people to talk about who framed roger blobaum.

His name is like Adam Baum only more intense. Roger that, blow the bomb. Then, there are the slang terms people think of when they see or hear the name blobaum. Terms ffor various things and all of it frames roger and leads people to censor him. Thus the book was called who censored roger rabbit. Yet their is a silver lining for roger. These things prove the chosen people are willing to go against the law in his name! Roger changed the way the american jews think in a big way. Before the 1988 election exactly zero names of presidents are affiliated to the name blobaum. 

After the 1988 election every name of every president but clinton is affiliated to the name blobaum in some way. You dont have to take my word for it either. The proof is already in your mind. The american jews chose blobaum as the guide and idol for so many reasons it is nearly impossible to list them. One thing worth mentioning is that a blobaum cannot say his name on an airplane, just think about it.
 
	1. A bush is like a baum (tree)
	2. blobaum has obaum in it
	3. trump is like baum
	4. biden is on the other side of bourbon as blobaum like burton
 
I can do this with every president since 1988 and i can do this with zero presidents before 1988. This is because of what roger blobaum did to influence the power.
